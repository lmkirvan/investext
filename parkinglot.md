Since you're using Python, the watchdog library is the gold standard. It monitors your Obsidian folder and triggers Python functions when a file is saved.

How the Python Watcher works:

    Event: You save a file in Obsidian.

    Trigger: watchdog catches the on_modified event.

    Parse: Use a library like python-frontmatter to separate the YAML (metadata/notes) from the body.

    Update DB: * Compare the last_synced timestamp in your DB with the file's mtime.

        Update the human_notes table with any new text you wrote.

        Update the tags table with any new tags added to the YAML.
